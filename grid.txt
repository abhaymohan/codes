grid

=> data structure
1. matrix

=> algorithm

1. recursive approach to visit the matrix
2. using memoization and tabulation to optimize the complexity

=> problems 

=>fixed starting point and fixed ending point
1. unique paths 2 - leetcode - 63
2. unique paths 1 - leetcode - 62
3. maximux/minimum path sum - leetcode - 64

=> fixed starting point and variable ending point
